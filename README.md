# Exploration

A collection of small programs, coding challenges, and scripts where I explore concepts in Computer Science that I find interesting

Here I will use any language I want in the moment, with several build systems;
this repo will not be pretty. However, I hope this repo will allow me to
explore my interests in software, and share some of my exploration with anyone
who cares to look.

Checkout the main repo on my [Gitea](https://git.clortox.com/tyler/Exploration), where I use issues to track ideas on what things I would like to explore.

You can also find the public mirror of this repository on [Github](https://github.com/Clortox/Exploration).
