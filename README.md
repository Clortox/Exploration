# Exploration

A collection of small programs, coding challenges, and scripts where I explore concepts in Computer Science that I find interesting

Here I will use any language I want in the moment, with several build systems;
this repo will not be pretty. However, I hope this repo will allow me to
explore my interests in software, and share some of my exploration with anyone
who cares to look.
